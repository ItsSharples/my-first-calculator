# my-first-calculator
This isn't actually my first calculator, but it's in that vein :p

## Versions
I tested it in 3.7 and 3.8. Don't use in in Python 2 ffs, that's been deprecated.\
## Python Notes
It's now using Pattern Matching, so the limits of how big you want it are much more relaxed.
But bigger than 100 and it gets really slow to build the structure.
## Other NOTES
O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity, So don't use a size above 100 if you want it to compile quickly.
