# my-first-calculator
This isn't actually my first calculator, but it's in that vein :p

## Versions
I tested it in 3.7 and 3.8. Don't use in in Python 2 ffs, that's been deprecated.\
## Python Notes
Don't use a size above 27 if you want to use it.
## Other NOTES
O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity, So don't use a size above 100 if you want it to compile quickly.
